# Hospital-Management-System
This mini-project contains the doctor-patient table with all records. for example Doctor name, Timing , speciality, and availability. 

## Project title:  

    Hospital Management System  in Java 

## Algorithm:

    We have used HashMap for implementing the management of the hospital. We have used the HashMap functions like .put() and .get() to do the functions of inserting values for     each sector concerned to doctor, staff, and patient and the latter function helps us in extracting the value for that person in any of either sector.
    Generally, HashMap uses the concept of the linked list which basically uses its function of interconnecting it’s the last node to the next node when there is a HashMap value collision, if it’s not so then too it works the same way but for each item the node of each item would be NULL. It’s value changes only in the case of HashMap value collision otherwise unaltered.

    We have initialized the header files to govern the function’s implementation easily with no error in the program.
    We have initialized the HashMap.
    We have declared variables.
    We will be taking the details from the user using the get() function which would be done certainly done in the void new() function.
    We have created another function named void info() which would be printing all the values concerned to the person in that sector.
    In the main method, we have called these functions by creating a new object to the concerned class and calling them using the object.that function().
    These procedures work the same in the case of a doctor, staff, and the patient.

    Through this implementation, we can handle the record of the hospital management on grounds of their doctor, staff, and patients.
    Using this program, we can know the details for each person in each parameter or update or add details about them which goes on storing them without failure.

## How it works :
<div align = center>
<img src = 'Images\Main menu.PNG' width = 400> 
<br>
<img src = 'Images\Doctors class.PNG' width = 400>
<br>
<img src = 'Images\Patient class.PNG' width = 400>
<br>
<img src = 'Images\MRI SCAN.PNG' width = 400>
<br>
<img src = 'Images\Custom test with random price.PNG' width = 400>
<br>
<img src = 'Images\Medical store (mask).PNG' width = 400>
<br>
<img src = 'Images\custom medicine.PNG' width = 400>
<br>
<img src = 'Images\cleaner.PNG' width = 400>

</div>





 ## Aim:  

    The application aims to provide the following features to make life for hospital staff extremely easy by making everything paper free: 

 

    *  Registering the patients with records and personal details such as name, age, sex, address, illness, hospital charges 
    *  Updating the patient details with time to time 
    *  Displaying patient details 
    *  Removing inactive patients. A patient is treated as inactive if he has been admitted to the hospital for more than 15 days. 

 

## Technologies used: 

    * Core Java 

 

## Assumptions taken: 

 

    This is an application for a hospital which takes records of its patients in a physical register. This application helps to make everything pen and paper free. It assumes that the files are only accessible to the staff so there are not special security measures are taken. It also assumes that there is 24/7 power supply with enough number of desktops. 

 

## Details handled 

* Managing Doctors: User can add new listings of doctors through that panel. and list can be modify and delete. deleted records will be displayed in tabular format which can be undeleted. 

* Managing patients: manage patient records and all the features such as modify, delete and undelete can be done on the records. 

* Appointments: appointments can be managed through doctor id and patient's id in the application. 

 

## Sample scenarios  

 

* Patients can check if the doctor they want to consult is available or not. Patients personal information will directly noted down very discretely. 

* Prescribed medicines and the doctor they go to are all stored in arraylist. 

 
## Who can use this application in real life 

 
* Any multispecialty hospital which wants to replace to the traditional, inefficient and time-consuming methods of storing and noting down the data manually with fully secure, connected and a reliable computer application.
